# MsDocExtension

# Overview
if you add the extension to your browser (edge or chrome), you can see the two additional button on top of document page.
- feed icon : you can access to atom feed of commits hisotry of the document page (english version).
- github icon : you can access to the original markdown file on github page (english version).

I hope this extension will help you to check update and diff of the document.
